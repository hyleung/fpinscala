# External Effects and IO

The goal here is to provide aâ€¦*way of embedding imperative programming with I/O effects in a pure program while **preserving referential transparency**.*

We separate the code that has *external effects*, from code that does not.

## Factoring effects

{% highlight scala %}
case class Player(name:String, score:Int)

def contest(p1: Player, p2: Player):Unit =
  if (p1.score > p2.score)
    println(s"${p1.name} is the winner!")
  else if (p2.score > p1.score)
    println(s"${p2.name} is the winner!")
  else
    println("It's a draw!")    
{% endhighlight %}

In the preceding example, we have side effects - that is `println`, which is I/O - mixed in with the pure logic.

We can move things in the right direction by factoring out the logic (i.e. who wins) into a separate function:

{% highlight scala %}
def winner(p1: Player, p2: Player):Option[Player] {
  if (p1.score > p2.score) Some(p1)
  else if (p2.score > p1.score) Some(p2)
  else None
}

def contest(p1: Player, p2: Player):Unit = winner(p1, p2) match {
  case Some(p) => println(s"${p.name} is the winner!")
  case None => println("It's a draw!")
}
{% endhighlight %}

This is *a bit* better. But `contest` still has two responsibilities here: computing the message to be displayed and *actually* displaying the message (printing it to console). We can refactor this further:

{% highlight scala %}
def computeMessage(p:Option[Player]):String = p map {
  case Player(name,_) => s"$name is the winner!"
} getOrElse "It's a draw!"

def contest(p1: Player, p2: Player):Unit =
  println(computeMessage(winner(p1, p2)))
{% endhighlight %}

We can take this a step further and create a type to represent the IO:

{% highlight scala %}
trait IO { def run:Unit }

def printLine(msg:String):IO = new IO{ def run = println(msg) }

def contest(p1: Player, p2: Player):IO =
  printLine(computeMessage(winner(p1, p2)))
{% endhighlight %}

Given an *impure* function, `f: A => B`, we can factor this as function, `A => D`, where `D` is some *description* of the result of `f` (`computeMessage`) and `D => B`, an *interpreter* of this result.

We can flesh out this `IO` trait by adding some operations:

{% highlight scala %}
trait IO { self =>
  def run:Unit
  def ++(io:IO):IO = new IO {
    def run = {
      self.run
      io.run
    }
  }
}

object IO {
  def empty:IO = new IO { def run = () }
}
{%endhighlight%}

i.e. we have formed a `Monoid` for our `IO` type.
